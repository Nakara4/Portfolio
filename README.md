Project Title and Description
Portfolio Website
Welcome to my very first portfolio website! This project is my introduction to web development, built with HTML and CSS. The site is designed to be simple, clean, and responsive, showcasing who I am, my skills, and the projects I’ve worked on so far. Think of it as my personal corner of the internet to share my journey as a budding developer.

Technologies Used
HTML5: The foundation for the structure and content of the site.
CSS3: To make the website look polished, organized, and responsive.
No frameworks or libraries: This is a hands-on learning experience, so everything is written from scratch.
Future Improvements
This project is just the beginning! Here are some ideas I’d like to explore as I learn more:

Add JavaScript: I plan to add cool interactive features, like a contact form that validates inputs.
Better Responsiveness: I’ll refine the layout to make it work even better on more screen sizes.
Go Live: Hosting the website online will make it easy to share with everyone.
Expand the Site: More content, such as additional projects, testimonials, or even a blog section, is on my wishlist!
